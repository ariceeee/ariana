I'm in the fifth (and final) year of my B.Sc. at the University of British Columbia, majoring in Psychology and minoring in Computer Science. Like many others, I got into computer science through the "I like video games... hmm, maybe it would be cool to make one" pipeline. My first programming language was Microsoft Visual Basic, which was a good place to start, but it was Java that truly got me hooked. Essentially, computer science makes the analytical, detail-oriented, problem-solver part of me happy, while also appealing to my creative nature.

These days, I'm into web dev and game dev. At any given time, there are an average of 3 game ideas running through my head. I'm always learning something new, because, as someone once told me, technology has the shelf life of a banana. As a bonus fun fact, I'm pretty crazy about Crocs, as in, I wear them every single day no matter the occassion, whether the temperature is 30 above, or 40 below with a windchill.
