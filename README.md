<h1 align="center"> Hey, I'm Ariana :-) </h1>

I'm a third year Computer Science student at the University of British Columbia and avid writer. I've been coding in Java for almost 4 years now and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for 3. If I'm being honest, I'm not quite sure what I'd like to do with my degree just yet but I'm loving the process of exploring new things. I'm interested in game development, production engineering, and artificial intelligence, as well as tech's application to the health and fitness industry. When I get the chance, I enjoy challenging myself with competitive programming, hackathons, and mountain hikes.
